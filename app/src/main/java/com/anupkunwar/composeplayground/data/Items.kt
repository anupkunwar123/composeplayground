It was a sign I was in TÅ«hoe country, the tribal region whose people were named âChildren of the Mistâ by ethnographer Elsdon Best in the 1890s due to an ancient oral tradition linking TÅ«hoe to Hine-pÅ«kohu-rangi, the mist maiden.\n" +

Turning a bend in the road, two stocky ponies with unkempt forelocks appeared on the dusty verge in front of me. Slowing down, I scanned the bush for kererÅ«, the native wood pigeon long associated with this fertile landscape, and instead locked eyes with a lone palomino chewing on ferns as the asphalt road turned to earth.\n" +

In 2014, a world-first law brought an end to government ownership of Te Urewera National Park and recognised the rainforest as its own legal entity and the TÅ«hoe people as its legal guardians.\n" +

                "Today, the TÅ«hoe â who number approximately 40,000, with around 7,000 living in Te Ureweraâs river valleys and bush clearings â are legally responsible for the rainforestâs care. They protect the precious site through an ancient Maori practice known as kaitiakitanga, which can roughly be translated to mean âguardianshipâ and is a way of managing the environment based on a MÄori worldview."
